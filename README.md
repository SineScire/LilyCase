## Assembly

Required parts for this step: PCB, 5x m2x5mm Brass Inserts, Switchplate, soldering iron.
Place the switchplate down with the standoffs facing up and place the Lily58 PCB on top as show in the image, the PCB prevents excess deformation of the Switchplate when inerting the brass inserts and ensures a proper fit afterwards.
Insert the 5 Brass Inserts into the hightlighted openings.
