A tented case for the Lily58 with a gasket mounted switchplate. The Lily58 is originally created by [kata0510](https://github.com/kata0510), the case is made to use with the Lily58L created by [BenRoe](https://github.com/BenRoe).

There are multiple versions of the case
* With magnets: has holes for 6x2mm circular magnets for the palm rest and tag plate, wrist rest is recessed deeper for an additional plate.
* Without magnets: the wrist rest has to be attached with double sided tape or glue, magnet holes for the tag plate are still present.
* The files and directories with the "old" suffix are from the original case design, where the IO for the PCB is rerouted to bottom case housing.

And multiple versions of the gaskets:
* Soft: Switchplate flexes with the press of a single key
* Medium: Switchplate flexes with the press of multiple keys
* Hard: Switchplate hardly flexes with the press of multiple keys
