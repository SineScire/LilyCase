### Preparing the switchplate
* Parts needed: Switchplate, Washers, m2x4mm threaded inserts, m2x5mm socket head screws, soldering iron.
1. Place the switchplace with the standoffs facing up, in the same suggested orientation it was printed in and place the PCB onto the switchplate as shown in the image below.
2. Using a soldering iron, insert the five m2x4mm threaded inserts into the switchplate at the blue highlighted spots in the image below.
