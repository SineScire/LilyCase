### Preparing the switchplate
* Parts needed: Switchplate, Washers, m2x4mm threaded inserts, m2x5mm socket head screws, soldering iron.
1. Place the switchplace with the standoffs facing up, in the same suggested orientation it was printed in and place the PCB onto the switchplate as shown in the image below.
2. Using a soldering iron, insert the five m2x4mm threaded inserts into the switchplate at the blue highlighted spots in the image below.

3. After having cooled down use the washers and the m2x5mm socket head screws to fasten the PCB to the switchplate.

4. Assemble the switchplate/PCB further with your choise of switches and keycaps.

### Preparing the top housing
* Parts needed: Top housing, m3x5mm threaded inserts, soldering iron.
1. Place the top housing facing down and using a soldering iron, insert the six m3x5mm threaded inserts into the top housing shown at the blue highlighted spots in the image below.

### Assembling the case
* Parts needed: Assembled top housing, assembled switchplate/PCB, gaskets, twelve m3x6mm socket head screws.
1. Slide the gaskets onto the lips of the switchplate as shown in the image below.

2. Place the switchplate on the bottom housing and place the top housing on top, sandwiching the gaskets and switchplate in between. The switchplate and gaskets should align them selves and the lip of the top housing should sit around the edge of the bottom housing.
3. Use six m3x6mm socket head screws to fasten the case together, completing one side of the case!
